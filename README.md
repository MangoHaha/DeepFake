# DeepFake
Deepfake, a portmanteau of "deep learning" and "fake",is an artificial intelligence-based human image synthesis technique. It is used to combine and superimpose existing images and videos onto source images or videos. A machine learning technique called a "generative adversarial network" (GAN) can be used to create fake videos.
